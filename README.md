# Real-Time Embedded Systems Course's Projects

This repository contains my computer assignments of real-time embedded systems course. This course had one major project and four minor projects. Minor projects' goal was preparing for a major project in which we selected ourselves.

## Minor Projects

* Computer Assignment 1: Introduction to motors in Arduino.
* Computer Assignment 2: Introduction to connections between boards like I2C and Serial.
* Computer Assignment 3: Implemention of a simple Android app using Gyroscope and Gravity sensors to move a ball on screen according to physics equations and seeing phone intraction with sensors using sysTrace tool.
* Computer Assignment 4: Implementing `Daisy Chain` interrupt management algorithm with 5 atemga32 boards.

## Major Project
 A real-time robotic arm with recording functionality. The main goal of this project was maximizing recording time according to the low value of the Arduino board's storage.
